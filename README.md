# Personal Portfolio

## Description
This repository contains my submission for the weekly assignments of the of Web technologies and e-Services course at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

In this assignment, I created a static website based on the instructor's requirements, which involved building a personal portfolio. The website includes an "About" section to introduce myself, a "Work" section to showcase completed projects, and a "Contact" section, along with a footer â€” all as the lecturer's requirements.

The website was built using HTML and CSS to create a static page, with some additional JavaScript for implementing smooth scrolling when users click on the navigation links in the navbar.

## Screenshots
Below are some screenshots of the static website I built for this assignment, showcasing its different sections and design elements.
